The jj4nsw.org website, like most websites, uses third party services to provide it with information relating to its members and users. These services include (but are not limited to) Google Apps, Google Analytics, NationBuilder, Facebook and Twitter. These services may collect your information such as stored cookies, IP address, geographical location, connected social networking accounts and other information. This information can be used to identify you.

As part of the services they provide, the companies listed above use your information according to their privacy policies.

## How we use your data
The jj4nsw.org uses data collected to analyse the effectiveness of our campaigns and to identify people who are actively interested in the James Jansson Team for NSW. The James Jansson Team for NSW does not sell your information to third parties and uses information collected about you for internal processes only.

## This website is not a private communication service
Although we will do our best to protect the privacy of the people using our website, the James Jansson Team for NSW may be required by law to disclose information to law enforcement officials. The website and the services used on this website are hosted in foreign jurisdictions by foreign companies. As such, communications made on this website may be intercepted by law enforcement agencies following due process, but may also be intercepted by law agencies operating outside of normal due process without proper oversight (such as the National Security Agencyâ€™s surveillance activities).

## How to avoid being identified
If you wish to not be identified by people in the James Jansson Team for NSW while visiting our website, we believe that simply using private browsing will prevent us from identifying you.

However, there are other techniques that our third party services and law enforcement agencies can use to identify you (e.g. using browser configuration characteristics, IP addresses etc). Additionally, if you are browsing from Australia, [Australian ISPs are forced by law to retain data](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=r5375) about your browsing habits. This data is accessible by certain government organisations without warrant. The use of VPNs and/or the Tor Browser may obscure your identity further, however they cannot guarantee your privacy.

## Google Analytics
We allow Google Analytics to collect data about your browsing activities via [Google advertising cookies](https://policies.google.com/technologies/types) and [anonymous identifiers](https://policies.google.com/privacy/key-terms#toc-terms-identifier).

We have implemented the Google Analytics features that allow us to analyse the demographics, location and interests of the visitors to our site. This data may be determined either through your registration to other services you use with Google, or through data derived from your browsing habits.

The Google Analytics terms [encourage us](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2700409) to link to the [Google Analytics opt-out browser plugin](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/). Although this may prevent the James Jansson Team for NSW from identifying you, we believe that this is a bad way to prevent Google from tracking your activity online. Other ways that you can reduce your information sharing with Google is included on [this page](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads).
