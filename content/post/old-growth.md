## Old growth logging to be banned in NSW, replaced with increased plantations 

The James Jansson Team formally announces it will end old growth forest logging in NSW. 

James Jansson, lead candidate, said "Our team acknowledges the important part the timber industry plays in Australia. In fact, we expect timber product demand to increase, as society shifts way from plastics in the consumer sector. We also expect the popularity of cross-laminated timber used in new wooden 'skyscrapers' to increase, meaning we need a lot more timber."

The James Jansson team will investigate ways to create more space for plantation timber, as an investment in the state's future ability to supply timber both to projects at home and abroad.

Andrea Leong, the ticket's second candidate said "By simultaneously ending old growth forest logging and increasing plantation timber production, we can protect our biodiversity while ensuring that we don't damage existing industries."

The team is in column S - all the way to the second from the right - in the Legislative Council ballot paper (upper house). View our how-to-vote [here](/how-to-vote-for-the-james-jansson-team-for-nsw).
