The James Jansson Team for NSW is planning for a bigger, brighter future for NSW. We're free of vested interests and factional forces. We're focused on delivering results to the people of NSW. We're the candidates for humans.

We're primarily made up of members and volunteers for the [Science Party](https://www.scienceparty.org.au/). The Science Party is not registered at the state level, we are running an independent ticket. Read the [Federal Science Party policies here](https://www.scienceparty.org.au/federal_policy). The James Jansson Team does not receive funding from the Science Party.
