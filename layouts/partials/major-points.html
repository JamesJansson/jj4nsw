        <p> Housing in our capital cities is expensive, but it doesn't need to be.</p>
        <p>
          Australia has a long history of creating new towns. We're looking forward and building a new city between Sydney and Canberra, called Turing. Placed between Sydney and Canberra on a high-speed train line, Turing will be a place that is desirable for people who have family in either Canberra or Sydney, and may even have jobs in those cities. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Built as high density from the outset, it will have a subway  built before buildings go up for driverless buses, cars and goods vehicles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The city will be cheap to rent or buy in, while having high quality infrastructure due mostly to the density of the city. Density will be a requirement: buildings must create a minimum amount of liveable space per square meter of land.

        <p>Review the system for assessing socioeconomic status to ensure the most disadvantaged schools receive their fair share of funding.</p>
        
        <p>We strongly believe in increasing funding to schools to ensure that we can reverse what appears to be the slipping of Australian schools by global standards, and narrowing of the gap in academic achievement based on socioeconomic status (SES).</p>
          
        <p>The way in which SES is assessed should be reviewed. The current system assumes that students who attend private schools come from households with an average income for the local area as calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This calculation is flawed; students who attend private schools are, on the whole, from households with above-average income.</p>

            <li>Provide financial incentives for teachers to move to and remain in hard-to-staff schools.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> The NSW Department of Education and Training currently provides incentives for early-career teachers to teach in low-performance schools in the outer suburbs and regional and rural areas. However, these incentives do not remain for experienced teachers, which sees expert teachers migrate towards the inner city.</p>
        <p>Disadvantaged schools are therefore more likely to have less-experienced staff and higher staff turnover. This compounds the disadvantage, as schools and students need a stable staffing situation and highly qualified teachers to improve their outcomes.</p>

        <p>While raising the pay for teachers of hard-to-staff schools will not solve all of the problems of these schools, it will reduce problems that these schools face in terms of finding and retaining good teachers.</p>

      <div>
        <p>We'll create "extension school": additional optional schooling hours that can be used to give additional help to struggling students or to provide additional, more challenging material in the areas that students are interested in.</p>

        <p>Students of all backgrounds, regardless of wealth, should be able to participate in additional educational activities outside of regular classroom time. We propose an ‘extension school’ which provides educational interest and tutoring classes outside of regular school hours.</p>
            
        <p>Extension school can be used to provide either remedial lessons for students who are struggling, or more challenging material to those who are performing well in class. Extension school can be run in a similar fashion to out-of-school sports and arts activities. Making extension school optional gives students a sense of personal responsibility over their education.

      <div>
        <p>Available evidence suggests <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-017-0799-y">no advantage</a> to single-sex education. There is therefore no justification for separating children on the basis of sex or gender, when life is mixed-gender. Students are best prepared for daily interaction with the opposite sex earlier rather than upon entering university or employment.</p>

        <p>Single-sex schools are a hangover from decades and centuries past, when boys and girls were very strongly steered towards different paths in life as adults.</p>
            
        <p>Claims that adolescents should be shielded from the distraction of the opposite sex during adolescence as hormones take effect assumes heterosexuality. If the assertion is true, then single-sex schooling disadvantages same-sex attracted adolescents. Single-sex schools are also not necessarily inclusive of intersex students or those who make a public gender transition during their school years.</p>

        <p> This doesn't mean that every tree is sacred. If corridors are needed for vital infrastructure, for example high-speed rail, areas can be used.
