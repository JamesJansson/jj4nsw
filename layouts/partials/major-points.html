      <div>
        <p> Housing in our capital cities is expensive, but it doesn't need to be.</p>
        <p>
          Australia has a long history of creating new towns. We're looking forward and building a new city between Sydney and Canberra, called Turing. Placed between Sydney and Canberra on a high-speed train line, Turing will be a place that is desirable for people who have family in either Canberra or Sydney, and may even have jobs in those cities. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Built as high density from the outset, it will have a subway  built before buildings go up for driverless buses, cars and goods vehicles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The city will be cheap to rent or buy in, while having high quality infrastructure due mostly to the density of the city. Density will be a requirement: buildings must create a minimum amount of liveable space per square meter of land.

      <div>
        <p>What does 800% renewable power mean?</p>
        <p>One of the big problems with renewable power is reliability and sufficient capacity when it's needed. You can use batteries and hydro pumping stations for storage, which can increase stability. However, they are both expensive and have their own environmental problems.  </p>
        <p>By having excess renewable energy, if power supplied goes down to, say, 20% of what is required, there is still sufficient power in the system to meet everyone's needs.  </p>

        <p>Australia has already suffered massive biodiversity loss due to land clearing. </p>

        <p> This doesn't mean that every tree is sacred. If corridors are needed for vital infrastructure, for example high-speed rail, areas can be used. However, in the first instance we should consider preserving native forests, rather than remove them for the creating of wood products when alternatives exist. </p>
