        <p> Housing in our capital cities is expensive, but it doesn't need to be.</p>
        <p>
          Australia has a long history of creating new towns. We're looking forward and building a new city between Sydney and Canberra, call Turing. Placed between Sydney and Caberra on a high-speed train line, Turing will be a place that is desirable for people who have family in either Canberra or Sydney, and may even have jobs in those cities. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Built as high density from the outset, it will have a subway  built before buildings go up for driverless buses, cars and goods vehicles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The city will be cheap to rent or buy in, while having high quality infrastructure due mostly to the density of the city. Density will be a requirement: buildings must create a minimum amount of liveable space per square meter of land.
