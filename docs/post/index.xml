      <description>It starts today, and it starts with you Today we&amp;rsquo;re going live: with our amazing new video and website.
Our aim is to show the public that there is an alternative. A team with bright, positive ideas who are not beholden to vested interests and factional forces.
Our vision is to invest in public infrastructure, invest into people through their education and health care, and cut the cost of living by removing artificial constraints on housing that only benefits the wealthy.</description>
