        <p> Housing in our capital cities is expensive, but it doesn't need to be.</p>
        <p>
          Australia has a long history of creating new towns. We're looking forward and building a new city between Sydney and Canberra, called Turing. Placed between Sydney and Canberra on a high-speed train line, Turing will be a place that is desirable for people who have family in either Canberra or Sydney, and may even have jobs in those cities. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Built as high density from the outset, it will have a subway  built before buildings go up for driverless buses, cars and goods vehicles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The city will be cheap to rent or buy in, while having high quality infrastructure due mostly to the density of the city. Density will be a requirement: buildings must create a minimum amount of liveable space per square meter of land.

          We'll replace all demountables with permanent structures, and plan ahead to ensure that schools have sufficient capacity for predicted.

      <div>
        <p>Review the system for assessing socioeconomic status to ensure the most disadvantaged schools receive their fair share of funding.</p>
        
        <p>We strongly believe in increasing funding to schools to ensure that we can reverse what appears to be the slipping of Australian schools by global standards, and narrowing of the gap in academic achievement based on socioeconomic status (SES).</p>
          
        <p>The way in which SES is assessed should be reviewed. The current system assumes that students who attend private schools come from households with an average income for the local area as calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This calculation is flawed; students who attend private schools are, on the whole, from households with above-average income.</p>

            <li>Provide financial incentives for teachers to move to and remain in hard-to-staff schools.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> The NSW Department of Education and Training currently provides incentives for early-career teachers to teach in low-performance schools in the outer suburbs and regional and rural areas. However, these incentives do not remain for experienced teachers, which sees expert teachers migrate towards the inner city.</p>
        <p>Disadvantaged schools are therefore more likely to have less-experienced staff and higher staff turnover. This compounds the disadvantage, as schools and students need a stable staffing situation and highly qualified teachers to improve their outcomes.</p>

        <p>While raising the pay for teachers of hard-to-staff schools will not solve all of the problems of these schools, it will reduce problems that these schools face in terms of finding and retaining good teachers.</p>

        Extra curricular extension school for all

      <div>
        <p>We'll create "extension school": additional optional schooling hours that can be used to give additional help to struggling students or to provide additional, more challenging material in the areas that students are interested in.</p>

        <p>Students of all backgrounds, regardless of wealth, should be able to participate in additional educational activities outside of regular classroom time. We propose an ‘extension school’ which provides educational interest and tutoring classes outside of regular school hours.</p>
            
        <p>Extension school can be used to provide either remedial lessons for students who are struggling, or more challenging material to those who are performing well in class. Extension school can be run in a similar fashion to out-of-school sports and arts activities. Making extension school optional gives students a sense of personal responsibility over their education.

      <li class="expandablepoint" id="single_sex_schools">
        End single-sex public education
      </li>
      <div>
        <p>Available evidence suggests <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-017-0799-y">no advantage</a> to single-sex education. There is therefore no justification for separating children on the basis of sex or gender, when life is mixed-gender. Students are best prepared for daily interaction with the opposite sex earlier rather than upon entering university or employment.</p>

        <p>Single-sex schools are a hangover from decades and centuries past, when boys and girls were very strongly steered towards different paths in life as adults.</p>
            
        <p>Claims that adolescents should be shielded from the distraction of the opposite sex during adolescence as hormones take effect assumes heterosexuality. If the assertion is true, then single-sex schooling disadvantages same-sex attracted adolescents. Single-sex schools are also not necessarily inclusive of intersex students or those who make a public gender transition during their school years.</p>

    <h2>Economic responsibility</h2>
    We'll decrease the cost of doing business and improve our tax system to make the state work better. 
    <ul>
      <li class="expandablepoint" id="business_rent">
        Cut the cost of business rent
      </li>
      <div>
        <p>We'll cut the cost of doing business in NSW by decreasing the cost of rent.</p>
        <p>Greatly increasing the construction rate of new office space will put downward pressure on the cost of rent, meaning more money can be put into wages, innovating and returning value to customers. </p>
      </div>

      <li class="expandablepoint" id="payroll_tax">
        Remove payroll tax
      </li>
      <div>
        <p>Payroll tax is a brake on businesses hiring more workers as they grow.</p>
        <p>We'll replace payroll tax with a broad land value tax which will be fairly applied across the community. </p>
      </div>

      <li class="expandablepoint" id="stamp_duty">
        Remove stamp duty
      </li>
      <div>
        <p>Stamp duty is a massive tax on people who want to move as their circumstances change.</p>
        <p>It means more empty nesters are stuck in large houses they don't need, when they could be living in more suitable accommodation, while families are priced out of the housing they need.</p>
        <p>We'll replace stamp duty with a broad land value tax which will be fairly applied across the community. </p>
      </div>

      <li class="expandablepoint" id="land_value_tax">
        Land value tax - the fair tax
      </li>
      <div>
        <p>Land value tax is a way to ensure that the public infrastructure we need gets built, and the benefit to society is shared around, not simply given to those who are lucky enough to own land in the area.</p>
        <p>If the government builds a train station, the value of the housing surrounding the station goes up substantially. Tax payer funds are used to increase the value of the land, but the tax payer, who funded the line, would not get anything in return. </p>
        <p>We'll replace stamp duty and payroll tax with a broad land value tax which will be fairly applied across the community. </p>
        <p>Rather than pay large sums when transacting property, the tax will be lower and applied more evenly over the time a person holds the property. </p>

      <div>
        <p>People who are of Aboriginal descent are over-represented in NSW's correctional facilities.</p>
        <p>There are many reasons for this, and our team is going to work hard to bring the incarcerated Aboriginal population into line with the general population as a matter of justice.</p>
        <p>We'll investigate all avenues, but areas that we may investigate include:
          <ul> 
            <li> Looking rates at which relatively minor offences are pursued against Aboriginal people in comparison to the general population</li>
            <li> Investigating rates of successful prosecution, to determine if there is a general failure in the fairness of court proceedings</li>
            <li> Assessing access to sufficient legal representation </li>
            <li> Fixing poverty issues to ensure stable lifestyles for those at risk of offending </li>

                <p>Perhaps I&rsquo;m naive, but I did not anticipate the NSW government&rsquo;s latest move in the war on live music. We have people offering their services to test pills at festivals, but our Premier Gladys Berejiklian doesn&rsquo;t like that idea. So, instead, we&rsquo;re getting complex, onerous new regulations for music festivals (some details have been reported). A few festivals have cancelled their 2019 events, citing the large cost of compliance with the new regulations as the reason for shutting down. ...  </p>
